# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish an automated deployment pipeline for TabloCrawler that builds ARM64 Docker images specifically for Raspberry Pi via GitHub Actions and provides automated SSH-based configuration management for Raspberry Pi devices. The Docker container will run only the user-monitoring functionality of TabloCrawler, enabling seamless deployment and configuration on IoT devices like Raspberry Pi.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated GitHub Actions pipeline that builds Docker images specifically for Raspberry Pi ARM64 architecture, so that I can deploy the user-monitoring feature of TabloCrawler to Raspberry Pi devices without manual compilation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that builds Docker images
2. WHEN the Docker build workflow runs THEN the system SHALL build images only for ARM64 architecture targeting Raspberry Pi
3. WHEN the Docker images are built successfully THEN the system SHALL push them to a container registry with appropriate tags
4. WHEN building for ARM64 THEN the system SHALL use Docker buildx with QEMU emulation for cross-platform builds
5. WHEN the Docker container runs THEN the system SHALL execute only the user-monitoring functionality, not the table scanning features
6. WHEN tagging images THEN the system SHALL include version tags and latest tag for ARM64 architecture

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated SSH-based configuration management for Raspberry Pi devices, so that I can deploy and configure TabloCrawler without manual setup on each device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the configuration tool THEN the system SHALL connect to Raspberry Pi devices via SSH using key-based authentication
2. WHEN configuring a Pi THEN the system SHALL install Docker if not already present
3. WHEN configuring a Pi THEN the system SHALL pull the appropriate ARM64 Docker image
4. WHEN configuring a Pi THEN the system SHALL create and configure environment files with necessary API tokens and settings
5. WHEN configuring a Pi THEN the system SHALL set up systemd services for automatic startup and restart on failure
6. IF Docker is already running on the Pi THEN the system SHALL stop existing containers before deploying new ones

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GitHub pipeline to be triggered by releases and pull requests, so that I can test builds and create versioned deployments efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new release is created THEN the system SHALL build and tag Docker images with the release version
2. WHEN a pull request is opened THEN the system SHALL build Docker images for testing without pushing to registry
3. WHEN building from a release tag THEN the system SHALL create both versioned tags and update the latest tag
4. WHEN building from pull requests THEN the system SHALL only build images for validation purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want inventory management for multiple Raspberry Pi devices, so that I can deploy to multiple devices efficiently and track their configuration status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing multiple devices THEN the system SHALL support an inventory file listing Pi hostnames, IP addresses, and SSH credentials
2. WHEN deploying to multiple devices THEN the system SHALL support parallel deployment to reduce total deployment time
3. WHEN a deployment fails on one device THEN the system SHALL continue deploying to other devices and report the failure
4. WHEN checking device status THEN the system SHALL verify that containers are running and services are healthy
5. IF a device is unreachable THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other devices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment configuration to be version controlled and templated, so that I can maintain consistent configurations across environments and track changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating configuration templates THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific variable substitution
2. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use Jinja2 or similar templating for configuration files
3. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL support encrypted storage of sensitive configuration values
4. WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL backup existing configurations before applying changes
5. WHEN rolling back THEN the system SHALL support reverting to previous configuration versions
